        <p>I am doing this as the part of my lab assignment. It is weirdly wonderful
        how I can manipulate the elements in the website. I can do so much only when I 
        have learnt HTML, I wonder how fun it will be after I learn CSS and JavaScript. I 
        believe it will add the icing to the cake!
